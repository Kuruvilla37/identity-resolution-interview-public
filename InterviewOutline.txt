This is an outline of the interview sections and approximate time allocations.
The length of the sections can be (and often are) adjusted up or down.
As we continue to do interviews remotely, we strongly encourage screensharing
this document in an editor and using it as space to share notes, thoughts,
or rough design diagrams as needed.
